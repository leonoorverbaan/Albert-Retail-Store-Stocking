Top-level xacro macro and related files which combines the panda and boxer into a single robot description (and any other hw which may be part of Albert).

This could contain separate xacro macros for Albert "variants", or those variants could use different packages. Depends a bit on how different the variants are.

If it makes sense, we could also give different Albert variants their own description package.
