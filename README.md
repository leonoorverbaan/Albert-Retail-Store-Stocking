## About
Welcome to the code of the albert robot! In this simulation in ROS I provide a knowledge driven retail store simulation where a robot is tasked to handle objects while adhering to some basic rules. With my team we use Prolog to define propositional logic rules for the store, and the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to then convert these rules to actionable outputs through predicates and actions. For more detail look into our paper/report: [Albert Retail Store Stocking](https://github.com/leonoorverbaan/Written-technical-papers/blob/main/Albert_retail_store_stocking.pdf).

## Method
Albert is supposed to reason about each item and infer its placee on one of the tables as per the defined store rules and following tasks:
- [ ] Sorting items based on their product category
- [ ] Sorting items based on their expiry priority levels
- [ ] Gathering items for online orders
- [ ] Discarding empty or mexpired items
- [ ] Failure Recovery
